# Introduction ()

## Additive manufacturing (AM) - (*ISO/ASTM 52900:2021 definations*)

**Additive manufacturing (AM)** is the general term for those
technologies that successively join material to create physical objects
as specified by 3D model data.

### Presently used for

-   various applications in engineering industry
-   as well as other areas of society, such as medicine, education,
    architecture, cartography,
-   toys and entertainment.

### Principal
\small
-   Applies the additive shaping principle and thereby builds physical
    three-dimensional (3D) geometries by successive addition of
    material.

-   Additive manufacturing(AM) process of joining materials to make
    parts from 3D model data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to
    subtractive manufacturing and formative manufacturing methodologies

-   Historical terms include: additive fabrication, additive processes,
    additive techniques, additive layer manufacturing, layer
    manufacturing, solid freeform fabrication and freeform fabrication.

-   Rapid prototyping

# Process categories

*ISO categrorise into 7 types*

1.  **Binder jetting (BJT)** process in which a liquid bonding agent is
    selectively deposited to join powder materials

2.  **Directed energy deposition (DED)** process in which focused
    thermal energy is used to fuse materials by melting as they are
    being deposited "Focused thermal energy" means that an energy source
    (for example laser, electron beam or plasma arc) is focused to melt
    the materials being deposited.

3\. **Material extrusion(MEX**) process in which material is selectively
dispensed through a nozzle or orifice

4.  **Material Jetting (MJT)** process in which droplets of feedstock
    material are selectively deposited

Example feedstock materials for material jetting include photopolymer
resin and wax.

5.  **Powder Bed Fusion (PBF)** process in which thermal energy
    selectively fuses regions of a powder bed

6.  **Sheet Lamination (SHL)** process in which sheets of material are
    bonded to form a part

7.  **Vat PhotoPolymerization (VPP)** process in which liquid
    photopolymer in a vat is selectively cured by light-activated
    polymerization



# Introduction History

## Key supporing technologies  
<!-- Ref Gibson -->>
- 3D graphics and CAD/CAE technology developed 
- Improvement in computing power and PC doing real time tasks
- Reduction in mass storage cost
- Machine control equipment similar to CNC, photocopier, laser printer
- Networking, sensors for actuators and positioning

- Slice data standard format STL by 3D Systems[^1]

[^1]: 3D Systems, USA (Charles Hull) is the First company filed patent and successfully commercialised AM

## Associated technolgies

- Lasers focussed controllable power, heating & curing
- Printing technologies - Printer head droplet temperture and pressure
- Programmable Logic Controllers used as machine building blocks
- Materials for AM, from photo-curable materials

- CNC Machining 

- Use of Layers
